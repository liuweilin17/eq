Assumptions regarding POIs:
The popularity of POIs depends on distance from the requests and the type of POI.

testing steps:
1. Obtain POIs popularity data and create binary label as 1, 0. 1 represents popular and 0 represents not.
2. Feature engineering. We normalize the distance with 0-1, and assign different type of POI as some integer numbers.
3. Calculate the correlation matrix, KL-divergence to see whether our assumption is corrent.

conclusions:
The popularity of POIs depends(or not) on distance from the requests and the type of POI.
